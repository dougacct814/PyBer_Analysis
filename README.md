# PyBer-Analysis

## Challenge Overview

The CEO tasked us to create an overall snapshot of the ride-sharing data. In addition to our scatter and pie charts, she wants to see a summary table of key metrics of the ride-sharing data by city type, and a multiple-line graph that shows the average fare for each week by each city type.

The goals for this challenge are for you to:

1. Use Pandas functions like groupby, pivot, resample, and reset_index on a DataFrame.
2. Use Pandas methods and attributes on a DataFrame or Series.
3. Create a new DataFrame from multiple groupby() Series.
4. Format columns of a DataFrame.
5. Create a multiple-line graph.
6. Annotate and apply styling to the chart.

## Resources

* Data Source:  city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
* Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code, 1.38.1

## Challenge Summary

### Summary Data Frame
The DataFrame that was created highlighted the following:

1. Urban Areas experience a much higher number of rides and total fares.
2. The highest average fares per ride and per driver occur in Rural Areas.
3. There is a significant drop in rides in the Rural Areas.
4. The total fares for both Rural and Suburban combined was approximately half of the overall Urban Fares.

### Summary Chart

The Chart that was created highlighted the following:

1. The Fares over time remain parallel have a similar trend.
2. All of the city types experience an increase of fares in February 2019.
3. The Suburban Areas experienced an increase in Fares in April while the Rrual and Urban both decrease.
